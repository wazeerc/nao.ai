## ✨ Features

- 💬 **Chat with any Model**: Seamlessly interact with any language model supported by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/search).
- 🧠 **Reasoning Insights**: View the internal thought process of thinking/reasoning models.
- 📑 **RAG Document Support**: Securely upload and chat with your documents (.pdf & .txt) using Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

- 🪄 **Easy Docker Setup**: Get up and running with a single command using Docker Compose.
### 🆕 RAG Support

nao.ai now supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to chat with your documents:

- **Supported formats**: PDF and TXT files (up to 15MB)
- **Upload documents**: Click the 📎 attachment icon in the chat input
- **Contextual responses**: Get answers based on your uploaded documents, solving the problem of "hallucination" in AI responses.

## 🚀 Getting Started with Docker

This is the easiest and recommended way to get started.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### 1. Download `docker-compose.yml`

Download the `docker-compose.yml` file from the repository. You can download it manually or use the following command:

```bash
mkdir nao.ai && cd nao.ai && curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wazeerc/nao.ai/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### 2. Create `.env` File

Create a file named `.env` in the same directory and add the following content (or use `echo`):

```bash
NUXT_PUBLIC_OLLAMA_MODEL="deepseek-r1:1.5b"
NUXT_PUBLIC_EMBEDDING_MODEL="nomic-embed-text"

NUXT_PUBLIC_OLLAMA_URL="http://localhost:11434"

COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=nao-ai
```

> [!NOTE]
> The model will be automatically downloaded the first time you start the application. You can find more models on the [Ollama Library](https://ollama.com/library).

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Stop the Application

To stop the application, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development Setup

For those who prefer to run the application without Docker.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installed locally

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure Your Models

Follow step 2 from the "Getting Started with Docker" section to create and configure your `.env` file.

### 3. Run Ollama

Pull and run your desired model with Ollama.

```bash
# Pull the main model
ollama pull deepseek-r1:1.5b # Replace with your chosen model

# Pull the embedding model for RAG support
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### 4. Start the Dev Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
